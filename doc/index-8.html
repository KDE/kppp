<H2><A NAME="security"></A> <A NAME="s8">8. <EM>kppp</EM> and Security Issues</A></H2>

<P>This section is mainly for superusers (root), people with high
security demands or simply technically interested people. It is
not necessary to read this if you only use Linux at home for
yourself (though you might learn something new when you read
this)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 Restricting access to kppp</A>
</H2>

<P>A system administrator might want to restrict access to who is
allowed to use <EM>kppp</EM>. There are two ways to accomplish this:
<P>
<H3>With group permissions</H3>

<P>Create a new group (you might want to name it "dialout" or
similar), put every user that should be allowed to use <EM>kppp</EM>
into that group and type:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
chown root.dialout /usr/local/kde/bin/kppp
chmod 4750 /usr/local/kde/bin/kppp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This assumes that KDE was installed in <CODE>/usr/local/kde</CODE>
and your new group is named "dialout".
<P>
<H3><EM>kppp큦</EM> way</H3>

<P>Before doing anything, <EM>kppp</EM> checks if there is a file named
<CODE>/etc/kppp.allow</CODE>. If such a file exists, ONLY users named
in this file are allowed to dial out. This file must be readable
by every user (of course NOT writable). Only login names are
recognised, thus you cannot use UID큦 in this file. Here큦 a
short example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /etc/kppp.allow
# comment lines like this are ignored, 
# as well as empty lines
fred
karl

# I put myself in here :-)
mweilguni
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

In the example above only the users <I>fred</I>, <I>karl</I> and
<I>mweilguni</I> can use <EM>kppp</EM> to dial out, as well as every
user with a UID of 0. So you don큧 need to put <I>root</I> in this
file.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 <EM>kppp</EM> has the SUID bit on. What about security?</A>
</H2>

<P>It큦 virtually impossible to write a dialer without the SUID bit,
that is both safe and easy to use for unexperienced
users. <EM>kppp</EM> addresses the security issues with the following
strategy:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Immidiatly after program start, <EM>kppp</EM> forks.</LI>
<LI>The master process (which does all GUI stuff, user interaction
and such) drops the SUID state afterwards, and runs with normal
user privileges.</LI>
<LI>The slave process keeps it큦 privileges, and is
responsible for all actions that need root privileges. To keep
this part safe, no KDE/Qt library calls are used here, just
simple C library calls. The source code for this process is short
(around 500 lines) and well documented, so it큦 easy for to check
it for security holes.</LI>
<LI>Master and slave process communicate with standard UNIX IPC.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Many thanks to Harri Porten for writing this excellent piece of
code. I thought it was impossible - he made it within a week.
