<title>Starting the Wizard.</title>

<para>You can start the wizard from &kppp;'s initial screen.  Start &kppp; from
your <guimenu>K</guimenu> menu, where you will find its entry in the
<guisubmenu>Internet</guisubmenu> as <guimenuitem>Internet
Dial-Up Tool</guimenuitem>.</para>

<para>The following dialog will appear:</para>

<para>It will probably not have any entries to begin with, and that's what we're
about to do now.</para>

<para>Click the <guibutton>Configure</guibutton> button to open the <guilabel>&kppp; 
Configuration</guilabel> dialog. On the <guilabel>Accounts</guilabel> tab select 
<guilabel>New</guilabel> to begin setting up a new
Internet connection.</para>

<para>The dialog will offer you three choices, <guibutton>Wizard</guibutton>,

<listitem><para>If you have a fairly standard modem, and use one of the larger
ISP's for your country, the wizard will probably be able to set you up
immediately with a working Internet Connection. Try this first, before you try
to set up the connection manually.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If you don't succeed with the Wizard, or you just want to do

<para>For the purposes of this chapter, we'll assume you are choosing
<guibutton>Wizard</guibutton>, and the dialog based setup will be described in a
later chapter.</para>

<title>The Rest of the Wizard</title>

<para>The first screen you see contains just introductory text, explaining the
things you read about in the first section of this chapter.  Press
<guibutton>Next</guibutton> to move on.</para>

<para>The second screen asks you to choose the country you live in.  Not all
countries are represented here, and if the country you live in is not listed,
you will have to press <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton>, in which case the <link
linkend="dialog-setup">Dialog based setup</link> will start for you to continue
with.</para>

<para>On the next screen, you will be given a choice of Internet Providers that
&kppp; knows about, based on your choice of location in the previous screen.
Again, if your <acronym>ISP</acronym> is not listed here, you will have to press
<guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> and do your setup in the <link
linkend="dialog-setup">Dialog based setup</link></para>

<para>You will now be asked to enter your username and password for your
internet connection.  Please note, that for some <acronym>ISP</acronym>s this
differs from your mail account user name and password, so make sure you use the
right one. Choose <guibutton>Next</guibutton> to continue.</para>

<para>On the next screen, you have a chance to enter any special dial prefixes
you might have - for example, if you must dial <quote>0</quote> for an outside
line, or if have a prefix you can dial to turn off call waiting.  Choose
<guibutton>Next</guibutton> to continue.</para>

<para>And that's all!  If you want to revisit any of your choices, you can use
the <guibutton>Back</guibutton> and <guibutton>Next</guibutton> buttons to move
back and forth through the dialogs.  When you're happy, press the
<guibutton>Finish</guibutton> button, and you're all done.</para>

<para>Of course, any of this information can be edited at a later time, from the
&kppp; Configuration dialog.</para>
