</H2>

<P>Before reporting a problem or potential bug to the 
<A HREF="index-1.html#maintainers">maintainers</A>
 of <EM>kppp</EM>, 
please make sure that you have read the section 
<A HREF="index-7.html#&lt;em/kppp/ FAQ">Frequently asked Questions</A> carefully.
<P>If you still have problems, you need to include the following informations
with your report:
<UL>
<LI>The version of <EM>kppp</EM> you are using. <I>kppp -v</I> will show the
version number.</LI>
<LI>The version of pppd you are using. <I>/usr/sbin/pppd -h</I> will show
the number.</LI>
<LI>What operating system and version you use. <I>uname -a</I> will tell you this
information on most UNIX systems.</LI>
<LI>If <EM>kppp</EM> reports "pppd died unexpectedly", add the <I>debug</I> option
to the 
<A HREF="index-4.html#pppd arguments">pppd arguments</A>. Dial again to
reproduce the error.<P>Now the file <CODE>/var/log/messages</CODE> (this depends on your system and
configuration, but a typically installed Linux system will have this. Of
course you must have root permissions to read this file) will have a lot of
debugging output at the end. <B>Don't send us the whole file</B>. It
typically has several thousands of lines and we neither have time nor are we
willing to process such a file. Just send us the last lines that
contain <I>pppd</I>, instead. Make sure that this file does <B>not</B> contain security compromising information such as passwords or usernames. Replace such entries with something like "myusername" and "mypassword"
