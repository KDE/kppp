TODO
====
o modem-setup wizard
o provider-setup wizard
o Create an own dialer communicating with slots. This will allow non-X kppp´s
o Separate GUI and non-GUI code in different classes
o Enhance "Send" to allow special (control) characters
o version detection of pppd fails on debian (rwsr-x---). Allow manual conf.

Dropped
=======
o MS-CHAP support (since this relies on pppd, we cannot do it)
o separate setup and dialer (very difficult, both parts would require to be 
  be SUID)

Done
====
o signal catching for accounting
o help users with those "pppd died unexpected..." bugs
o CHAP support
o All modem related code should be put in one class
o replace "$" in config entries with "$$"
o button for clearing volume accounting
o better FAQ (it´s better now, still not perfect, and will never be)
o deal with interfaces different from ppp0
