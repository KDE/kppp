# This is a kppp ruleset for Eircom (formerly Telecom Eireann)
# for standard local calls (NOT special-rate Internet 1891 calls).
#
# Unbelievably, Eircom has now dropped the former (ludicrously
# irrelevant) distance-based charge-bands on direct-dialled calls.
# They still remain for operator-connected calls but these are
# (a) a rarity and (b) unusable for modems anyway. Calls in Ireland
# are therefore in one of the following categories:
#
# 1. Local calls
# 2. Special-rate Internet calls (ISPs with 1891 numbers)
# 3. National calls (ie all other trunk or long-distance calls)
#
# Note that some Telcos offer special deals of a fixed-rate per-month
# charge which gives you unlimited, uncharged local calls in off-peak
# times. At other times, your standard Telco rates apply.
#
# "Local" is as hard to define as in any other Telco administration,
# as it can cross area codes, even when they are in different regions,
# in order to allow people to call their neighbours 100 yards away
# even though they may technically be in an area code which would
# normally qualify as "long-distance", because such calls don't go
# onto the trunk, just the local exchange.
#
# Note all values here include Value-Added Tax at 21% current
# at 31-Dec-1999

# Define IEP (Irish Pounds) to be used as currency symbol
# ??? There is no way to define the currency code AND the symbol !!!
# WARNING this will have to be changed to EUR from 2002-01-01
currency_symbol=£

# Define the position of the currency symbol.
# (not absolutely needed, default is "right")
# ??? Curious default, why not left, which is _way_ more common? !!!
currency_position=left 

# Define the number of significant digits.
# (not absolutely needed, default is "2"
currency_digits=2

# NOTE: rules are applied from top to bottom - the
#       LAST matching rule is the one used for the
#       cost computations.

# It costs 11.5p the moment a call connects. This covers the first
# 3 mins (peak hours, 8am-6pm M-F) or first 15 mins (off-peak)
per_connection=0.115

# Therefore the minimum cost is the same as the per-connection cost
minimum_costs=0.115

# Therefore the first 180 secs costs this much no matter what.
flat_init_costs=(0.115,180)
# A pity there's no peak/offpeak differential for this one.

# All subsequent charging is done per-second, based on the unit
# charge of 11.5p for 3mins (peak hours) or 11.5p for 15mins
# (off-peak), which works out at £0.000638889/sec and £0.000127778p/sec
# respectively...that's what they claim, anyway.

# Rather than expect kppp to check the rate every second and add
# tiny fractions, I've expressed these rates in terms of the amount
# needed to clock up half a penny (or the closest amount exceeding
# that value obtainable by multiplying the per-second rate by an
# integer). Not a whole penny, because you may be damn certain the
# bean-counters will round up half-penny amounts to the nearest
# whole penny anyway (anal-retentive, are we? :-)

# Thus the base rate for peak-time calls is £0.005111 for 8 secs
# (0.115 / 180 = 0.000638889 / 0.005 = 0.127778 inv = 7.8261)
# and off-peak is £0.005111  for 40 secs 
# (0.115 / 900 = 0.000127778 / 0.005 = 0.25556 inv = 39.1304)
# so accounting should happen in approx 1/2p increments...

# OK, here we go...

# Because of the need to detect time-of-day as well as initial-period, 
# this default should never actually get applied, but we assume that
# connections are made in the peak rate period...
default=(0.005111,8)

# PEAK-TIME CALLS are 8am to 6pm Mon-Fri, so after flat_init_costs

# OFF-PEAK CALLS are 6pm to 8am Mon-Fri plus all day weekends and holidays

# This file should be refreshed every year to take account of the
# moveable public holidays we inherited from the British practice,
# known as "Bank Holidays" (originally the quarter-days when banks
# had to close for accounting purposes, but now almost unpredictable).
# These happen several times a year, always on a Monday. Dates 
# for 2000 are June 5th, August 7th, and October 30th.
# The exact dates are known several years in advance and are fixed
# by the Taoiseach's Office and the Dept of Local Government.
# They are NOT the same days as British Bank Holidays, which are
# fixed on a different basis.
