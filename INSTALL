It is assumed that you have already successfully installed pppd.
For more info see the PPP-HOWTO.

INSTALLATION:

./configure

Now check the kppp/config.h file ( Linux users should be fine )
then:

make 
make install

o If you run "make install" as root the kppp binary will be installed
  setuid root. Otherwise you can do this on your own:
  cd $(KDEDIR)/bin ; chown root kppp; chmod +s kppp. This might not 
  be absolutely necessary ( depending on the permissions 
  set on the modem device, /etc/resolv.conf etc. but if you can 
  afford to, this will make your life much easier.

o if you can't give kppp setuid permission, here is the deal:
  In order for kppp to be able to update /etc/resolv.conf,
  /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets, respectively,
  the users of kppp must have write permissions to these files 
  and of course the modem device. It's up to you to figure
  the right permissions. ;-)

o make sure that the pppd's option file which usually resides
  in /etc/ppp/ exists, but is empty. pppd wants it to exist,
  but we don't want pppd to take any options from it. kppp 
  will hand pppd the necessary options.

o when you run kppp for the first time you need to create and
  configure kppp for you ISP account. I hope kppp was written 
  so that you will have no difficutlies understanding the many 
  options offered. Please make use of the html help documentation
  if you have questions.

  
that's it, 
happy dialing!
